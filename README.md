This utility looks through text files and does a string search and replace. 
The resulting files are saved with a .txt extension, so Hello.clw becomes Hello.clw.txt

It was written as a learning exercise to understand how hand coded Clarion programs work
and how to put everything together to create a working program. Hopefully it is sufficently 
well documented to explain what is going on and how it all works.

The debug library isn't absolutely necessary, but has been extremely helpful in finding
bugs and getting the program to work as required.
